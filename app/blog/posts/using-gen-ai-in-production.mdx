Gen AI and LLMs (Large Language Models) continue to be a hot topic, and at their current pace of development, they're not likely to be going anywhere anytime soon. LLM-powered APIs such as OpenAI's GPT-4 are making it easier than ever before to leverage these models to turbocharge existing software applications or even build entirely new products. But how can you go about building Gen AI into your products? In this article, we'll break it down into 5 simple steps. Let's get started!

## 1. Engineering Your Prompts ‚úèÔ∏è

It all starts with engineering your prompt. This involves a few upfront decisions such as picking the model that's appropriate for your use case, writing a prompt that succinctly summarizes the task and relevant context, configuring any prompt parameters available to you, and finally deciding whether to further refine the model you're using through fine-tuning or parameter-efficient-tuning.

### 1.1 Finding the Perfect Model ‚ù§Ô∏è

Unfortunately, this isn't a simple story of Prompt Engineer meets LLM and they lived happily ever after. Rather, navigating the Gen AI marketplace can be incredibly daunting. When looking at sites like [HuggingFace ü§ó](https://huggingface.co/) (a site that allows access and evaluates different Gen AI models), it's easy to become overwhelmed. But let's help you through that feeling of choice paralysis by going through a few of the key factors to consider when evaluating your options:

- **Modality** ‚Äì What type of content do you want to generate? Images, text, audio, video, or even a combination of multiple? Depending on your circumstances, you might even need to consider using multiple models. Different models produce different content types, so being clear on your use case and objectives is key.
- **Cost** ‚Äì What's the charge per API call? How many API calls will you have to make to deliver value to your users? What's the length of the inputs and outputs? Will you be charging your users, and if so, how will this cover your costs? All of these questions can help guide you towards an appropriate model.
- **Response Time** ‚Äì How important is it to get an immediate response to your users? Does speed beat quality or is it the other way around? This trade-off is worth considering when picking a model, even from the same provider. For example, ChatGPT-3.5-turbo is widely accepted to provide lower quality responses compared to its powerful younger sibling, ChatGPT-4. However, it easily has it beat on speed.
- **Context Limit** ‚Äì How long is the average message you'll have to send and receive from the API? Different models have different context limits, and this might guide you between choosing Anthropic's Claude 2 with its context limit of ~100k tokens versus GPT-4's default context limit of ~4k.
- **Quality of Response** ‚Äì There are a few different metrics that are widely used to compare Gen AI models. [HuggingFace ü§ó](https://huggingface.co/) has a published list of the top performers. Different models are better at different task types. Ultimately, it might be best to try out a few different models for yourself and understand what works best for you.

### 1.2 Writing Your Prompt

Once you've firmed up your base decisions around which model is right for you, you can delve into the world of prompt design. Best practices around how to do this are constantly evolving, but generally, it's accepted that a well-crafted prompt will cover the following:

- **Context** ‚Äì Provide relevant context to the GenAI that will be helpful in ensuring a high-quality output. E.g., "You are an assistant that helps people plan trips."
- **Instruct** ‚Äì Outline clear instructions that succinctly detail what is expected. E.g., "Plan a trip to Paris for a couple for 2 days."
- **Examples** ‚Äì Provide examples of the expected response. This is also known as single-shot or even multi-shot prompting depending on how many examples are provided.
- **Response Format (if relevant)** ‚Äì It can also be useful to state how you expect to get a response. This could vary from being more vague and giving the LLM much greater flexibility to being highly prescriptive. E.g., "Provide a response as valid JSON with the following key-value pairs."
- **Dealing with Uncertainty** ‚Äì If the LLM is unsure in its response, it's often effective to give it permission to say so. This helps you minimize hallucinations (LLMs providing factually incorrect information) and is often preferable to it confidently providing an incorrect response.

## 2. Test, Test, and Test Again üßë‚Äçüíª

Testing is crucial when integrating Gen AI into your applications. Here's how to ensure your AI behaves as expected:

### 2.1 Dive into AI's Unpredictability

Prepare for GenAI to sometimes offer different responses to identical prompts. This inherent non-determinism complicates testing scenarios, as the AI might produce varying results even under the same conditions. To manage this, it is important to develop robust testing methodologies that account for these variations, ensuring that the AI's performance remains consistent and reliable over time.

### 2.2 Root Tests in Reality

Construct canonical datasets and test cases that mirror genuine user interactions and business contexts. Establishing and maintaining these datasets is essential, as they provide a realistic foundation for evaluating the AI's performance. By grounding your tests in real-world scenarios, you can better predict how the AI will behave in actual use cases, leading to more effective and practical deployments.

### 2.3 Key Challenges

One of the primary challenges in testing GenAI is its inherent non-determinism, which makes it difficult to predict and evaluate the AI's responses. This unpredictability requires a thorough and dynamic approach to testing, incorporating various test cases and scenarios to ensure comprehensive coverage.

Another significant challenge is establishing and maintaining canonical datasets that accurately reflect real-world user interactions. This involves continuous effort to keep the datasets up-to-date and relevant, ensuring they remain a valid benchmark for testing the AI's performance. Automated test runs based on these datasets can help streamline the process, but they require careful setup and ongoing maintenance to be effective.

## 3. Deploy with Confidence üöÄ

Deploying your GenAI model into a production environment is a critical step that requires meticulous planning and monitoring to ensure seamless integration and optimal performance. Here‚Äôs how to deploy with confidence:

### 3.1 Roll Out Flawlessly

Transitioning your GenAI-powered model from a development environment to production involves several key steps:
